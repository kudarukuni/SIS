A.I
Intelligence property also ability atributted(given) to people who can know, think, talk, learn

intelligence = knowledge + ability to passive, feel, comprehend, process, communicate
                                             judge, learn 

A.I is an interdesciplianary field aiming at developing techniques and tools for solving
problems that people are not good at.

David Marr "AI is the study of complex information processing problems espeacially the
 ones that have roots in some aspect of biological information processing. the goal is
 to identify information processing problems and solve them"

Tom Dean "AI is the design, study & construction of computer programs that behave intelligently"

Matt Ginserg "AI is the enterprise of constructing a physical symbol system that can
 realibly pass the turing test"

the above definitions advocate everything from replicating human intelligence to simply solving
knowledge-intensive tasks.

GOALS
Scientific goal - understanding mechanism behind human itelligence.
Engineering goal - develop concepts and tools capable of solving real world problems.

INFERENCE RULES
-inference refers to generating conclusion from evidence and facts
-applied to deprive proof in A.I i.e a sequence of the conlusions
 that leads to the desired goal

First Order Logic Inference Rules for Universal and Existential Quantifiers
 
-universal generalization: states that if premise P(c) {p of c} is true for any arbitary element c
 			   in the universe of discourse then conclude ∀x P(x) {for all x p of x}
					 P(c)
					∀x P(x)

-universal instantiation: states that we can infer an instance P(c) by substituting ground term c
			  from any object in the universe of discourse ∀x P(x). 
			  if every person likes ice cream we can infer that John likes ice cream
					∀x P(x)
					 P(c)

-existential instantiation: states that one can infer P(c) from the formula ∃xP(x) {there exist x p of x}
			    for a new constant symbol c.
					∃xP(x)
					 P(c)

-existential generalization: states that if there is some element c in the universe of discourse
			     which has a proprety P then we can infer that there exists something in 
			     the universe which has property.
					 P(c)
					∃xP(x)
Propositional logic Inference Rules

propositional logic is the simplest logic.
Types of inference rules: Resolution, Modus Ponense, Modus Tollens, Destructive Dilemma, Constructive Dilemma, 
	Hypothesis Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Simplification, Addition.

Relations
*implication: P -> Q
*converse: Q -> P
*contraposition: `Q -> `P
*inverse: `P -> `Q

Connectives
`	: not		: negation
A	: conjuction	: true when both is TT
V	: disjunction	: true when either is T
->	: implication	: true when `(TF)
<->	: equivalence	: true when both TT & FF
0	: exclusive or	: true when `(TT) & `(FF)


FUZZY LOGIC
-FL is a method of reasoning that resembles human reasoning. Computers making human like decisions.
-That is to say it involves all intermediate possibilities between YES & NO. Has been implemented 
 in micro-controllers and also in hardware/software/both.

	Fuzzy Input set					Fuzzy Output set

Rules
All rules & If-Then conditions offered by the exports to control the decision making system

Fuzzifier(Fuzzification)
Converts crisp numbers input into fuzzy sets. sensors can measure crisp inputs.

Intelligence/Inference Engine
Determines degree of match b/w fuzzy input and rules. according to the crisp input field converted into
a Fuzzy Input set) it decides on next fired rules to form control actions hence, fuzzy output sets.

Defuzzifier()
Converts fuzzy output sets into crisp number output.

MEMEBERSHIP f(x)
- is a graph used to define each input mapping to memebership values laying between 0 and 1.
- allows the quantification of linguistic terms
- represents a fuzzy set graphically
- a membership f(x) for fuzzy set A on universe of discourse X = uA:X -> (0,1)

Fuzzy 				vs		 	Probability
Capture the essential concept of vagueness		Associated with events (may or not occur) and not facts
Capture the meaning of partial truth			Captures partial knowledge
Takes truth degress as a math basis			Mathematical model of ignorance

Fuzzy Logic Applications
Aerospace field for altitude control of spacecraft and satelite
Controls speed and traffic in automotive systems
Decision making support systems
Controls the pH drying, chemical distillation process in the chemical industry
Natural Language Processing and various intensive application in A.I
Used un mordern control systems

Why use Fuzzy Logic?
1. Controls machines and consumer products.
2. If not Accurate atleast Acceptable Reasoning.
3. Deals with uncertanity in software/hardware engineering

Advantages						Disadvantages
-Easy and Understandable				-Not always accurate
-Widely used for comercial and practical purposes	-Cannot recognize machine learning & nueral network partens
-Control machines					-Extensive testing required to achieve Validation & Verification
-Reduce uncertanity in software/hardware engineering	-Difficult task in seting fuzzy rule and membership functions
-Roburst as no precise inputs required			-Easily confused with probability
-Easily modifiable to improve/alter system perfomance
-Use of expensive sensors hence low cost & complexity
